## WeatherPy
Study purpose: 
Identify any apparent relationships between weather patterns and proximity to the equator.  

Observations:
1. When comparing the latitude and max temperatures of both the southern and northern hemisphere, there does appear to be a moderate relationship indicating that proximity to the equator correlates to higher max temperatues. 
2. When comparing both cloudiness and humidity to proximity to the equator, there is no significant relationship between either variable and equator proximity. 
3. There does not appear to be any significant linear relationship between wind speeds and the proximity to the equator. 


## VacationPy
Study Purpose:
Leverage a client's preferred weather conditions to identify desirable vacation destinations and find the nearest lodging. 

Considerations:
- When using the google API search type of 'lodging', at least one location was returned that was actually a prison (let's hope our clients do not end up there). In future analysis, we may consider including additional details such as reviews, prices, or keyword of "hotel" to avoid this issue.  While the client's preferred weather conditions may be a step towards finding an ideal vacation spot, there may be more benefit to searching for nearby tourist attractions or specific activities.
