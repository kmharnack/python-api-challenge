## VacationPy
Study Purpose:
Leverage a client's preferred weather conditions to identify desirable vacation destinations and find the nearest lodging. 

Considerations:
- When using the google API search type of 'lodging', at least one location was returned that was actually a prison (let's hope our clients do not end up there). In future analysis, we may consider including additional details such as reviews, prices, or keyword of "hotel" to avoid this issue.  While the client's preferred weather conditions may be a step towards finding an ideal vacation spot, there may be more benefit to searching for nearby tourist attractions or specific activities.
